// Question 121: Implement a for loop that counts from 1 to 10 but skips number 5 using the continue statement.

// Explain & TIP: The continue statement can be used to skip over an iteration in a loop. It's particularly handy when you want to ignore specific cases without stopping the entire loop.

for (let index = 1; index <= 10; index++) {
    if (index === 5){
        continue
    }
    console.log(index);
    
}
