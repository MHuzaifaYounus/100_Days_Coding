// Question 61: Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks, and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

// Explain & TIP: Enums are like special lists in your code that help you categorize things. They make your code cleaner and easier to understand.

enum vehicles {
    cars, // 0
    trucks, // 1
    motorcycles, // 2
}

console.log(vehicles.cars); // it will prints 0
